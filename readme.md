# Write a simple blog

Using your own code to demonstrate good use of php oop patterns.

- Must use PDO, use either mysql or sqlite (if you use mysql please include a schema file)
- Full working frontend where you can navigate pages and posts, we are looking at how you implement routing, error handling (404) and pagination. There should be at least a home page, a post listing page and a contact us page.
- Login page to access the admin
- The admin must have at least a post listings page with a option to edit and update a post, a post must contain a title, summary and body. We are looking at your form/input handling, error checking and validation.

This shouldn't take more than 2-3 Hours. Try and make sure the above is complete and tested before adding any other features.
