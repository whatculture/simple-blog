# PHP Challenge: Write a Simple Blog

Using your own code, demonstrate good use of PHP OOP patterns by creating a simple blog. The blog is required to contain the following:

- PDO, either mysql or sqlite (if you use mysql please include a schema file)
- Fully working front-end where you can navigate pages and posts, we are looking at how you implement routing, error handling (404) and pagination. There should be at least a home page, a post listing page and a contact us page
- Login page to access the admin
- The admin must have at least a post listings page with a option to edit and update a post, a post must contain a title, summary and body. We are looking at your form/input handling, error checking and validation

This shouldn't take more than 2-3 hours. Try and make sure the above is complete and tested before adding any other features.
